#Description: You are setting up a business and need to compute the break-even point.
#This indicates howmany items you must sell at a given price to cover your overhead.
#Enter fixed costs, price per unit and cost per unit into your program. 
#Compute the break-even point by dividing fixed costs
#by the difference of price per unit and cost per unit.
#Create variables
fixed_costs = 0
price_per_unit = 0 
cost_per_unit = 0
break_even_point = 0
#Get user inputs 
print("Enter fixed costs:")
fixed_costs =input()
print("Enter price per unit:")
price_per_unit = input()
print("Enter cost per unit:")
cost_per_unit = input()
#Compute break even point
break_even_point = int(fixed_costs) / (int(price_per_unit) - int(cost_per_unit))
#Display result 
print(f"The Break even point is:{break_even_point}")
