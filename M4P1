#Description: Allow the user to enter two exam scores from
#the keyboard. The first exam is worth 60% of the total
#points and the second exam is worth 40%. Calculate the
#total score by multiplying each exam score input by the
#respective weighting then add the two results together.
#Display the total.
#Create variables for exam scores 
exam_one_total = 100
exam_two_total = 100
exam_one_score = 0
exam_two_score = 0
total_score = 0
exam_one_weight = .60
exam_two_weight = .40
#Ask user for exam scores
print("Enter exam one score:")
exam_one_score = input()
print("exam one:", exam_one_score)
print("Enter exam two score:")
exam_two_score = input()
#calculate the weighted grade
(exam_one_weighted_total) = float(exam_one_score) * (exam_one_weight)
(exam_two_weighted_total) = float(exam_two_score) * (exam_two_weight)
total_score = exam_one_weighted_total + exam_two_weighted_total
print(f"Total Score: {total_score}")
